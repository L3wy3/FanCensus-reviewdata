An "npm run dev" is all you'll need to run it

I probably should have spent more time looking for a differant graph library, Canvasjs wouldn't let me add data dynamically,
Wish I could have spent more time on the UI as well that's my strength usually
I contemplated removing the countries that didnt have any data on each game but then I thought that's probably still useful data

thanks for any feedback you've got I'm guessing my total absence of components is an issue and maybe I'm too used to ancient legacy codebases as for me that's readable
